  storyText: 'Getting near the end of the tunnel, you hear some strange noises, you
    don''t understand what it is, a tiny patch of light emits from afar where the
    sound originates.  On your right, you see a well with a rope...


    Maybe
    someone''s there to help me?

    1. Go closer towards the sounds.

    2.
    Inspect the well.'
