  storyText: 'Coming closer to the barrel a foul smell gets you right off your feet,
    phew nasty! Now that you can see what''s inside you are shocked! Remains of what
    looks like human bones and skin! The sounds in the distance are gone... You turn
    around, pitch-black like staring in the void, nothing until again you feel a
    breeze, strangely with a foul smell.

    Before you realize it, the last thing
    that you feel is the 10 seconds remaining from your decapitated body...'
